The main part on education starts around the 44:00 mark. Highly recommend the entire interview.

> There's a lot of questions about what it is that people are getting with an education [...] The financial product it's closest to is an insurance product. People are basically investing in education to buy insurance so that they don't fall through the big cracks that exist in our society.

> You have to somehow engage in the reality. People are trying to buy insurance, and/or they're trying to win this tournament. That's the reality you should engage in.

> If we talk about education as learning, you're just taking the weird marketing at face value, and that's not even what's going on. If you're saying we're going to help do that better, most of the time you're not even wrong.
