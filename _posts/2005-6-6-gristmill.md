All you faithful readers might have noticed a drop in the number of posts
relating to the environment lately. That is because as of today, I'll be
sending all of those musings over to Gristmill as a contributor there. As a
result, this page will probably take on a slightly more informal feel, if
that's even possible, and topics here will likely be more un-environment-y in
nature. Perhaps even more of those
"[Update](http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/06/update.html)" posts where I
state where I am in the country and such things as what I'm doing. But kindly
direct your browser to [Gristmill](http://gristmill.grist.org/).
