Tomorrow I will begin making my way to Blanc-Sablon, Canada, for the 2008 International Endurance Aventure, otherwise known as the <a href="http://www.coastraid.com/en/index.html">Coast Raid</a>. We've got a great team together for what should be a very exciting race. <br /><br />The race organizers have informed us that the teams' progress will be monitored and posted online. Right now the site directs <a href="http://www.coastraidtracking.com/">here</a>, but right now it looks like last year's teams are up there. There's also a <a href="http://www.enduranceaventure.tv/">video feed</a> that I'm assuming will be updated as the race progresses.
