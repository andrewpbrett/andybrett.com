today on the country of Bhutan and how they measure progress not in terms of
GDP but GNH -- Gross National Happiness.

  
First, congratulations to the _Times_ for picking up on this late-breaking
story. </sarcasm>. Bhutan has been doing this for years.

  
Setting that aside (it's not really important), here's an excerpt from the
article:

> In the study, the researchers, Sara J. Solnick and David Hemenway, gave the
subjects a choice of earning $50,000 a year in a world where the average
salary was $25,000 or $100,000 a year where the average was $200,000.

  
About 50 percent of the participants, the researchers found, chose the first
option, preferring to be half as prosperous but richer than their neighbors.

Boy, I guess equality is really important, right? Equal-size slices of the pie
are more important than the size of the pie itself?

  
That may or may not be true, but this often-cited survey doesn't show it. The
question is poor; it leads the respondent to make a number of assumptions,
which may or may not be true. One is that in the world where the average
salary is $200,000, or in any world where the average salary is high, that
basic goods will cost more. Similarly, the respondent will likely assume that
in the lower-average-salary world, basic goods will cost less. In either case,
the person is inferring something about how much money it takes to live in
this hypothetical world, so the question is essentially "would you rather live
in a world where you had to spend most of your income on essential goods or a
world where you spent only a little on essential goods?"

  
In that case it's easy to see why most people might choose a society where
they don't spend that much time/money on essential goods. For fun, let's say
that a person in the 200,000/100,000 society spends one month/year on food,
rent, etc., and that the person in the 25,000/50,000 society spends 8
months/year on the same.

  
Now let's ask a different question to these people. Would you rather live in a
society where it takes you one month to obtain basic necessities but it takes
everyone else one week to do the same, or a society in which it takes you 8
months to obtain those same basic necessities but it takes everyone else 10
months? That's the question that should be asked. When 50 percent of people
come back and say "the 8 months/10 months society," let me know, I'll be
surprised.

  
Even if the original question is prefaced by saying that the actual cost of
living is the same, you are likely to still get a good percentage saying
they'd rather have half the income but live in a world where you make more
than everyone else. This can be attributed to people taking the information
that is given and ignoring it, since it would be difficult to believe in this
case.
