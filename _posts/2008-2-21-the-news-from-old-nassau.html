...where <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon_effect">all the children are above average</A>.<br /><br />As an alum, news about Princeton in the New York Times never fails to catch your eye. Princeton <a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/02/19/20141/">recently</A> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/education/19educ.html?ex=1361163600&en=e0e09c78c3f2fde7&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">announced</A> that they would be offering what they call a "bridge year" program for incoming freshman. The students, up to 10% of the incoming class when the plan is fully implemented, would spend the year doing service work abroad. <br /><br />The program would be a formalization of what many Princeton students already choose to do on their own; several of my friends have done this, either between high school and college or between two choice years during school.<br /><br />I think this is a brilliant plan. What a great way to offer some perspective on your four years of college and inspire you to use every last opportunity you can while you are there. <br /><br />Two caveats, however: <br /><br />- I'm wary of just how formal and structured it will be - after all, I'd say most of the benefits that my friends reaped when they had similar adventures came from the fact that they were fending for themselves. There is already a culture of study abroad, as <a href="http://community.nytimes.com/article/comments/2008/02/19/education/19educ.html?permid=10#comment10">this commenter</A> points out. I agree with his statement though I wouldn't go so far as to call it "an improved version of summer camp."<br /><br />- When I was graduating (Spring 2007) there was a bit of a Cold War going on between the administration and the eating clubs. Shirley T. would never admit this, but I'd say this program aids her cause quite a bit. I said above that it's a great way to gain perspective; no doubt part of that perspective will result in a greater aversion to drinking away the best seven years of your life at TI or the Street in general. <br /><br />That first caveat is part of something that's been rolling around in my head for a little while now, namely the whole concept of pre-defined structure and how it can be good and bad. Maybe that will my next post - or maybe it will be a book review for <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Zd1l0Ivij8wC&dq=unbearable+lightness+of+being&pg=PP1&ots=6CUN42nt0r&sig=CgvshATL1LcM24Kax80eedUBjqU&hl=en&prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=unbearable+lightness+of+being&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title&cad=one-book-with-thumbnail">The Unbearable Lightness of Being</A>, which I've almost finished and which has apparently been scanned by Google. <br /><br />For now I'm out to take one last look at the <a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/LEmono/TLE2008Feb21/TLE2008Feb21.html">lunar eclipse</A>.
