title: "Process"

Lately I've been thinking a lot about the abstract concept of a "process."
[Michael Pollan](http://www.michaelpollan.com/)
[lambastes](http://www.michaelpollan.com/indefense.php#) "edible food-like
substances" for being processed; at work we created a process to prepare,
coordinate, and execute test scripts, which are in themselves a process; [Tim
Ferriss](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) talks about [processing his
inbox](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/01/21/the-holy-grail-how-to-
outsource-the-inbox-and-never-check-email-again/) (or creating rules - a
process, essentially - so that someone who knows nothing about him apart from
the instructions is able to do it for him); and most recently, [Atul
Gawande](http://www.gawande.com/) ruminates on how mundane processes such as
proper hand-washing are the key to eradicating infectious diseases in
hospitals, and how wide-spread, well-planned, and coordinated processes can
effectively prevent a polio outbreak.

  
So what's in a process? And why do we come up with them? The major attraction
of a good process is that it is repeatable and will produce the same,
desirable results each time. In other words: think carefully about it just
once, and you'll never have to think about it again, and neither will anyone
else. We are now free to think about other, presumably more important, things
in your life.

  
A noble cause, for sure. But this line of thinking is what leads to Wal-Marts,
four-lane causeways, automated call centers, and fast food. Taken to the
extreme, the results are unpleasant to say the least. Henry David Thoreau went
into the woods as a reaction to what he saw as the industrialization of
everything, including men's souls. I can't find the quote online (I'll have to
find the book instead), but Thoreau writes about a person becoming simply a
cog in the great industrial machine - and this is in 1854. Some things don't
change.

  
I first read "Walden" in 2001, and again in 2004, while in the woods in
Vermont, which can give any book, but particularly this one, new meaning. The
book and Thoreau's thinking is deeply ingrained and intertwined with my own;
this may explain a realization that I came to recently, though probably not
for the first time: I am not very good at following a process. When I am the
executor, I have terrible attention to detail, I question every step, ignore
things that are crucial, get hung up on things that are not, and generally
just make a mess of the entire situation.

  
I would like to think that I am far better at designing a process, ensuring
that the desired results are achieved, that the process works in all
situations, and so on.

  
I don't think that this makes me unique though - after all, who wants to be
the sucker sitting there manually reading through Tim Ferriss' emails or doing
something else repetitive and boring, according to preset rules. No one! It's
mind-numbing and soul-sucking.

  
So should the end goal of process design include the assumption that
eventually, no one is going to be willing to be paid a pittance to follow a
process? That we'll all have better things to do? I'm not sure. It seems that
as long as there are young people still trying to figure the world out and
make a little cash, or (comparatively) poorer or less skilled people who are
willing to sacrifice mental stimulation in exchange for making a living (for
now, anyway, to quote Avenue Q), that it's a safe assumption to make that a
well-engineered process will always have takers at some price point.
