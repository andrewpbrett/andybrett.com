1. Create "Maximo Park Radio" on Pandora

  
2. Happen upon the song "We Don't Think, We Know," by Maritime

  
3. Catch the allusion in the lyrics: "All the days are just packed / And we're
asleep in the trees"

  
4. See if anyone else caught it -- [nope](http://www.google.com/search?q=we+do
n%27t+think+we+know+calvin+and+hobbes&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla
:en-US:official&client=firefox-a)! (Well, they didn't write about it anyway)

  
5. Write about it

  
6. Smile :-)
