<p>I really hope that this becomes more common, and not the exception that proves the rule. No middlemen, no signing up for something. Just a transaction between a creator and the people that want to enjoy something and will pay money to do so.

I'm also just going to assume that it was my <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-much-did-it-cost-Louis-CK-to-produce-Live-at-the-Beacon-Theater-Has-he-made-a-profit-on-it">question on Quora</a> that got him to post an <a href="https://buy.louisck.net/statement">update</a> on the (impressive) sales figures to date.

Further, from the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/n9tef/hi_im_louis_ck_and_this_is_a_thing/">AMA on Reddit</a>:<blockquote>It's like that thing in the movie "Twister" where they send a bunch of little data collecting balls up into a tornado and just download the lovely results. The whole things has been like that. From the moment it went online and i saw the result of every decision i made. the last question the web guys asked me before we posted was if I wanted the mail list button defaulted to "opt in" or "opt out" and i said start it at opt out. It's such a tiny thing but I keep hearing about it from people.</blockquote>
