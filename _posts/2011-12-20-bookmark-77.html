<p>Posted some thoughts <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-went-wrong-with-Jawbones-UP/answer/Andy-Brett">on Quora</a> after a few weeks wearing the UP. Three key flaws: 
</p><p>
- I still have to tell the UP what "mode" I'm in (normal, sleeping, or exercising).
</p><p>
- Syncing is awkward and unreliable.
</p><p>
- No API/data export, and no web interface.
</p><p>
I'm pretty excited for the <a href="http://mybasis.com/">Basis</a> to arrive, as it appears to address all three.</p>
