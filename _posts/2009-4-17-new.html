Welcome to the latest incarnation of Citing the Text, most recently <a href="http://citingthetext.blogspot.com">hosted</a> by Blogger. It's been a long time since the days of Xanga; hopefully this latest version is a little easier on the eyes.

I recently <a href="http://citingthetext.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-to-debian-lenny-enterprise-ruby.html">wrote about</a> how I decided to overhaul this site's architecture. This new blogging platform is the first of many features that the redesign will enable. 
<BR><BR> 
In the spirit of getting things out there in front of real users and iterating in response to feedback, this blog is being released in a deliberately unfinished state. It is certainly not a design masterpiece by any stretch, but it's something to build on.

Lastly, a million thanks to Ryan Bates and his always useful and inspirational <a href="http://www.railscasts.com">Railscasts</a>.
