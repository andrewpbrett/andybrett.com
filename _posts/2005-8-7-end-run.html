Matt Welch at <a href="http://www.reason.com/hitandrun">Hit and Run</A> <a href="http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/2005/08/the_nyts_uncons.shtml#010458">comments</A> on this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/opinion/05fri4.html?"><em>New York Times</em></A> editorial, which includes such choice phrases as "But blogs are often just a way of making oneself appear on the Internet" and "reifying the ephemeral daily conversation that humans engage in." Enough to send most people running for <s>the dictionary</s> <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster online</A>.<br /><br />Reminds me of a quote attributed to Gandhi:<br />"First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win."<br /><br />Right now it looks like they are in the ridicule phase. A futuristic vision of the fighting stage (<em>New York Times</eM> sues Googlezon) can be found <a href="http://www.jazzpodcasts.net/de/index.php/archive/off-topic-epic-2015/">here</A> by clicking on the EPIC 2015 link.<br /><br />An excerpt from the comments at Hit and Run:<br /><br />Now that newspapers are finally figuring out that bloggers are making an end run around their news monopolies, can the government be far behind?<br /><br />After all, bloggers and gamers are making way more peaceful contacts with people from other countries than the State Department, and not even bothering with a passport.<br /><br />Comment by: Larry A at August 5, 2005 03:30 PM<br /><br />---<br /><br /><em>and not even bothering with a passport.</em><br /><br />Shhhh. Don't give them any fancy ideas.<br /><br />Comment by: Stretch at August 5, 2005 04:16 PM
