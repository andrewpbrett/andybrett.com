title: "The Reasoned Right"

I'm now a contributor at the newly minted blog <a href="http://www.thereasonedright.com">The Reasoned Right</A>. I didn't like the name at first, but I will admit, it's starting to grow on me. The blog is....well, you might have to ask Rob about that, but my understanding is that it is a collection of libertarian thought.<br /><br />Don't you just love that new-car smell?
