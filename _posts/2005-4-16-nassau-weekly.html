Usually I just read the Verbatim and maybe look at some of Arthur's pictures, but this week's <a href="http://www.nassauweekly.com/">Nassau Weekly</A> is pretty good, especially the <a href="http://www.nassauweekly.com/view_article.php?id=291">feature article</A>, a methodical and thorough dissection of "Tangled Up in Blue" by Eleanor Barkhorn.
