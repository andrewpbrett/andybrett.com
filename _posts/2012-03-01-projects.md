###[Cake Health][1]

Cake Health is the easiest way to understand and optimize your health care. We're still in private beta but if you're reading this, shoot me an email and we'll work something out.

###This site ([source][2])

Uses the [Jekyll][3] blogging engine by [Tom Preston-Warner][4] with some custom ruby glue to display images from Dropbox. 

###Old site ([source][5])

Archetypical Rails blog. Used Rails 3.0+, jQuery, HAML, and SASS. Allows for hosted images, posts, updates (a la twitter), and bookmarks, as well as privacy controls via tags for all of the above objects. Sends a daily email reminder to post something for posterity's sake.

###Crunchhunch ([source][6])

Fun little game that lets you guess the author of the TechCrunch post based on the headline. Based on a bet with Paul Carr. Not maintained.

###[CrunchBase][7]

Free database of startups and technology companies, investors and people that anyone can edit. I didn't build it but rather worked on new features for it while at TechCrunch. Built with Rails 2.x.
