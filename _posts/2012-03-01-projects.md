###[Move Loot][11]

[Move Loot](https://www.moveloot.com) is a marketplace for used furniture that's much easier than using Craigslist. I built the iPhone and iPad app (universal binary). 

###[GTBee][10]

A simple to-do list iOS app that charges you for not Getting Things Done, via its integration with the [Beeminder API](https://www.beeminder.com/api).

###[Beeminder for iOS][9]

[Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com) is a tool for fighting akrasia - in other words, making yourself do the things that you want to do. I wrote the iOS app.

###[Whimsical][0]

A spontaneous adventure generator for iOS.

###[Run Calendar][8]

Integrates with RunKeeper to:

\- put your recorded runs on a calendar

\- let you plan upcoming training

\- track and plan mileage targets


###This site ([source][2])

Uses the [Jekyll][3] blogging engine by [Tom Preston-Warner][4]. 

###Old site ([source][5])

Archetypical Rails blog. Used Rails 3.0+, jQuery, HAML, and SASS. Allows for hosted images, posts, updates (a la twitter), and bookmarks, as well as privacy controls via tags for all of the above objects. Sends a daily email reminder to post something for posterity's sake.

###[Cake Health][1]

Cake Health is the easiest way to understand and optimize your health care.

###[CrunchBase][7]

Free database of startups and technology companies, investors and people that anyone can edit. I didn't build it but rather worked on new features for it while at TechCrunch. Built with Rails 2.x.

###Crunchhunch ([source][6])

Fun little game that lets you guess the author of the TechCrunch post based on the headline. Based on a bet with Paul Carr. Not maintained.
