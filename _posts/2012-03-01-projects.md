### [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com)

Beeminder is a tool for fighting akrasia - in other words, making yourself do the things that you want to do. I write the [iOS app][9] and a bunch of other code when Bethany lets me.

### [GTBee][10]

A simple to-do list iOS app that charges you for not Getting Things Done, via its integration with the [Beeminder API](https://www.beeminder.com/api).

### [Whimsical][0]

A spontaneous adventure generator for iOS.

### This site ([source][2])

Uses the [Jekyll][3] blogging engine.
