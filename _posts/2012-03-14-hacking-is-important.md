> Hackers are allergic to process not because they don't understand the value; they're allergic to it because it violates their core values. These values are well documented in Zuckerberg's letter: "Done is better than perfect", "Code wins arguments", and that "Hacker culture is extremely open and meritocratic". The folks who create process care about control, and they use politics to shape that control and to influence communications, and if there is ever a sentence that would cause a hacker to stand up and throw his or her keyboard at the screen, it's the first half of this one.

This is one of the better summaries of the hacker Weltanschauung, and how it contrasts with the rest of the world, that I've read in a while. 

Code. Wins. Arguments.
