My two principles of tax reform:<ul><li>Make the return fit on a postcard</li><li>Make people cut a check for the whole amount on April 15</li></ul>Both of these are examples like I <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/07/what-to-do-nothing.html">mentioned</A> yesterday of policies that make sense but have no chance of being enacted, because<ul><LI>The massive tax code and its pages of loopholes are a vehicle that delivers pork, which is the way politicians are reelected, and also keep tax shelters in business.</li><li>If people had to write a check for 20% of their yearly income once a year, the government would see a huge rise in the number of people that just couldn't pay the amount.</li></ul>The benefit to #1 is obvious. The benefit to #2 would be that people would feel the effects much more deeply and would be a little more interested in where their money was actually going.
