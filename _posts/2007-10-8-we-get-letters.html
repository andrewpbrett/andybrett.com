And how would we as individuals change our ways?</blockquote><br /><br />The first thing that jumps to mind is a conversation I had with a graduate student I was living with over a summer in Baltimore. She had a TON of hard copies of articles printed out that she was reading for the research we were doing, which was ironic because the research was on how deforestation in suburban watersheds led to more intense flood events. The response that I still remember was <b>"Sometimes you have to cut down a few trees to save the forest."</b> I see a parallel here. My argument to justify the fact that Accenture consumes many resources every day is that the resources are being consumed for a good purpose, namely, to support the people who design business systems and processes that are more efficient and consume fewer resources once they are put into place. Accenture in particular can make this argument because of its focus on high-tech companies and technical implementations. Many of these projects provide the backbone for, say, a company to be able to host meetings with clients remotely instead of flying people halfway around the world to Japan. <br /><br />The title of this post is a reference to the Letterman song, which is apparently a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Get_Letters">Perry Como</A>. In any case it makes me miss <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Deli">Rupert</a> and the <a href="http://www.hello-deli.com/">Hello Deli</A>.
