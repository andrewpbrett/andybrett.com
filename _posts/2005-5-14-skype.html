I am currently talking online to Leroy, OH, via SKYPE!  Or as I like to call it, (pun intended) the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Take <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/13/opinion/13friedman.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fOp%2dEd%2fColumnists%2fThomas%20L%20Friedman">Tom Friedman's advice</A>.  Go to <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype.com</A> and download it now.  If you are at Princeton and have one of those standard-issue Dells you don't even need a microphone or headset or anything.  It's great!
