<blockquote>The Internet no longer belongs to the young tech genius with a great idea and the means to execute it online. Innovation on the Internet now belongs to the world, and that is perhaps the most exciting thing about this space. It's attracting not just the "next Mark Zuckerberg," but also thousands of super smart innovators from every field imaginable, each of whom brings extraordinary insights and drive to play. And that's another reason I love this industry, because, in the end, it's not a singular business. It now encapsulates the human narrative, writ very large.</blockquote>
