Is it me or is [The Tory](http://www.princetontory.com/) getting less
offensive? Even a better publication perhaps? Ira Leeds' opening letter speaks
of the Socratic method in high regard and makes legitimate points about
academic debate. They publish a poignant letter to the editor even though it
rants about their Rant (and whose author I agree with and whose point I take a
step further: he says that there is a glimmer of good in the pages past the
Rant; I would say that in this issue the glimmer is becoming a light). Follow
that up with an article about tax reform, a Wilsonian world view, and some
necessary concerns about PCAIR, and you've got some quality on your hands. The
problem is that most people have already made up their minds about the content
coming from the Tory and will probably pitch it with exams approaching. I
would read it. You can get it
[online](http://www.princetontory.com/current_issue.htm) too if it doesn't
come to your mailbox.
