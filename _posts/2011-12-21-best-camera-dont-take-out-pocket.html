title: "The Best Camera Is the One You Don't Take Out of Your Pocket"
---
<p>
When I was younger I liked to read books about kids who were detectives, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Brown">Encyclopedia Brown</a>. There was another series about a girl named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Jansen#The_Cam_Jansen_mystery_series">Cam Jansen</a>, who was aided in her detective work by her photographic memory. When she wanted to remember a scene, she simply said, "Click!" and it was permanently preserved.

Soon, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/wearing-your-computer-on-your-sleeve/">anyone will be able to do this</a>. 
</p><p>
I have a feeling that <a href="http://path.com">Path</a> realized this a while ago and is skating to where the puck is going to be. Their cutesy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQwA5tWIMIc">demo video</a> shows seamless transitions between real life moments and the snapshots being captured in Path - in nearly every situation it would have been incredibly awkward to say "hold on, let me take out my camera to get a shot of this." Path is executing on the ideal model for this future world in that these moments are "private by default". No <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/25/color-digging">data is mined</a>, no social graphs are monetized.[1]
</p><p>
There are several other situations where some sort of wearable device vastly improves an existing use case. I encounter one almost every time I go <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/andrewpbrett/status/39046414503772160">running</a> - inevitably I'll want to capture some interesting piece of scenery, but I never bring my phone with me, and even if I did I wouldn't really want to stop to take it out. Put the <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-large-would-the-iPhone-4S-camera-have-to-be-if-the-device-did-nothing-but-take-and-store-pictures?q=how+large+would+a+camera">camera on my sunglasses</a> - boom. Problem solved.
</p><p>
Another use case in <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-went-wrong-with-Jawbones-UP/answer/Andy-Brett">need of improvement</a> is one of the "features" of the Jawbone UP - right now you're supposed to take a picture of every meal you eat. Sites like Foodspotting have managed to get the early adopter set to make a habit out of photographing every dish before they dig in, but if it's as effortless as saying "click," suddenly it's a lot easier to get people at risk for diabetes to keep a journal of what they're eating.

Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/samgrossberg">Sam Grossberg</a> for unwittingly listening to a first draft of this post over a beer a couple weeks ago.

[1] Here is my plea to Path: <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/"><strong>Don't let me be a free user</strong></a>. I know that I can buy filters and buy songs on iTunes via Path, but that's not really tied to the value that I'm getting from the app. How about a voluntary subscription a la <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>?</p>
