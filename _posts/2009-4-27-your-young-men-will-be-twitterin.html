<BR><BR> 
Well, either you're closing your eyes<BR> 
To a situation you do not wish to acknowledge,<BR> 
Or you are not aware of the caliber of disaster <BR> 
Indicated by the presence of the social web in your community.<BR> 
<BR> 
Well, you got trouble, my friend, right here,<BR> 
I say, trouble right here in River City.<BR> 
Why sure I'm a Facebook user,<BR> 
Certainly mighty proud I say<BR> 
I'm always mighty proud to say it.<BR> 
I consider that the hours I spend<BR> 
With a mouse in my hand are golden.<BR> 
Help you cultivate a network<BR> 
And a personal brand and a social graph.<BR> 
Ever take and try to find<BR> 
An iron-clad link from yourself<BR> 
To a Fortune 500 boss, in two connections or less?<BR> 
<BR> 
But just as I say,<BR> 
It takes judgement, brains, and maturity,<BR> 
To score in this online game,<BR> 
I say that any twit!<BR> 
Can take and tweet a text from their pocket<BR> 
And they call that Twitter!<BR> 
The first big step on the road<BR> 
To the depths of the Singularity -<BR> 
I say, first, <a href="http://twitter.com/pothos">informational texts from a plant</a>,<BR> 
Then <a href="http://portfolio.menscher.com/itp/kickbee/">tweets from a baby</a>!<BR> 
<BR> 
And the next thing ya know,<BR> 
Your son is bloggin' for money on a MacBook Pro.<BR> 
And listening to some big out-of-town VC<BR> 
Here to tell about somethin' called YouTube<BR> 
Not a wholesome television show, no!<BR> 
But a clip that you upload right there yourself!<BR> 
Like to see some stuck-up Charlie-boy<BR> 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM">Chompin' on his brother's thumb</a>? Make your Rick "roil," well, I should say.<BR> 
Now friends, let me tell you what I mean.<BR> 
You got one, two, three, four, five, six connections in the graph.<BR> 
Connections that mark the difference, <BR> 
Between a gentlemen and a bum,<BR> 
With a capital "B" and that rhymes with "C" and that stands for <a href="http://www.cuil.com">Cuil</a>!<BR> 
<BR> 
And all week long your River City<BR> 
Youth'll be twitterin' away,<BR> 
I say your young men'll be twitterin'!<BR> 
Twitterin' away their noontime, suppertime, choretime too!<BR> 
Get the pix up on Flickr<BR> 
Never mind gettin' blog feeds pulled<BR> 
Or the software patched or the corners rounded.<BR> 
Never mind sendin' any emails<BR> 
'Til your parents are caught with their inbox empty<BR> 
On a Saturday night and that's trouble,<BR> 
Oh, yes you got lots and lots of trouble.<BR> 
I'm thinkin' of the kids up on MySpace,<BR> 
Shirt-tail young ones, peekin' at the lolcats<BR> 
Website after school, you got trouble, folks!<BR> 
Right here in River City.<BR> 
Trouble with a capital "T" and that rhymes with "C" and that stands for <a href="http://www.cuil.com">Cuil</a>!<BR> 
<BR> 
Now, I know all you folks are the right kind of parents.<BR> 
I'm gonna be perfectly frank.<BR> 
Would you like to know what kind of conversation goes<BR> 
On while they're surfin' around that web?<BR> 
They're tryin' out Bebo, tryin' out Friendster,<BR> 
Tryin' out Tumblr logs like Stumblin fiends!<BR> 
And tweetin' all about<BR> 
How they're gonna delete all those photos on TwitPic from last night.<BR> 
They leave the Ping hall, headin' for Netflix Watch Instantly,<BR> 
CollegeHumor men and CuteOverload women!<BR> 
And Pandora! Streaming music, that'll grab your son, your daughter<BR> 
With the arms of a jungle animal's instinct!<BR> 
Mass-participation!<BR> 
Friends, the social brain is the devil's playground!<BR> 
<BR> 
Chorus:<BR> 
Trouble, oh we got trouble,<BR> 
Right here in River City!<BR> 
With a capital "T", that rhymes with "C", and that stands for <a href="http://www.cuil.com">Cuil</a>,<BR> 
We've surely got trouble!<BR> 
Right here in River City,<BR> 
Right here!<BR> 
Gotta figure out a way to keep the young ones offline after school!<BR> 
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble...<BR> 
<BR> 
Harold:<BR> 
Mothers of River City!<BR> 
Heed that warning before it's too late!<BR> 
Watch for the tell-tale sign of corruption!<BR> 
The minute your son leaves the house,<BR> 
Does he resize his urls below the character limit?<BR> 
Is there an overuse strain on his texting finger?<BR> 
A porn cookie hidden in his browser history?<BR> 
Is he starting to memorize facts from chucknorris.com?<BR> 
Are certain words creeping into his conversation?<BR> 
Words like "LOL"<BR> 
And "icanhascheezburger?"<BR> 
Well, if so my friends...<BR> 
<BR> 
You got trouble,<BR> 
Right here in River City!<BR> 
With a capital "T" and that rhymes with "C" and that stands for <a href="http://www.cuil.com">Cuil</a>.<BR> 
We've surely got trouble!<BR> 
Right here in River City!<BR> 
Remember the meme, OK GO, and the series of tubes!<BR> 
Oh, we've got trouble.<BR> 
We're in terrible, terrible trouble.<BR> 
That site with the social network graph is a devil's tool!<BR> 
Oh yes we got trouble, trouble, we got big big trouble!<BR> 
With a "T"! <BR> 
Gotta rhyme it with "C"!<BR> 
And that stands for <a href="http://www.cuil.com">Cuil</a>!<BR> 
That stands for <a href="http://www.cuil.com">Cuil</a>!<BR>
