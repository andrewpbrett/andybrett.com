Since I could do it without messing around online that much, I entered [this
essay
contest](http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/2005/05/how_to_make_2k.shtml#009667)
today. Not really expecting to win, but a chance at $2000 is a chance at
$2000. Can't hurt, and it was an interesting topic to write on.

  
To Baltimore!
