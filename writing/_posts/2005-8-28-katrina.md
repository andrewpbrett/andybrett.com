Katrina is [bearing down on New Orleans](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graph
ics_at2+shtml/151733.shtml?3day), and is scheduled to arrive at about 9 am
Monday morning. It's been upgraded to a category five storm.

  
Chris C. Mooney has some
[thoughts](http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=2090) over at his blog. His
article from May which he cites also contains this ominous tidbit:

  
_In the wake of such a tragedy [a "direct hit from a powerful hurricane on New
Orleans"], some may even question the wisdom of trying to rebuild the city at
all._
