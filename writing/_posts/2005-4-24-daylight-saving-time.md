title: "Daylight Saving Time"

The Energy Bill that just passed the House contains an interesting little
provision: daylight saving time would be extended by two months, one in the
spring and one in the fall, saving about [10,000 barrels of oil per
day](http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/04/07/daylight.saving.ap/). Every little
bit helps...
