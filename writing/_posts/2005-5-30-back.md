title: "Back"
---
So I am back, and by back I mean I'm in Ohio again. The trip to the
Shenandoahs was amazing. Lots and lots of sims, which included me getting
hypothermic, hypoglycemic, impaled with a stick, homesick, offended by my co-
leader's extravagant lifestyle, rambunctious, ASR, slower at hiking because I
"didn't realize my pack had a hip belt," and a broken ankle. Good times. The
"real" weather was not great, but not terrible either, mostly raining and
cold, but one day of pretty constant sun.

  
I should know more about plans in early June. Which is good, since I think
Princeton would appreciate me having it figured out by then, since after June
30th it looks like things get harder.

  
I did not get any comments under the last post with any exciting news
developments. All of you, and by that I mean both of you, failed miserably.
Unless, of course, nothing exciting happened over the past week. In which case
you're off the hook.
