title: "USA TODAY, tomorrow the world"

While I don't understand why "today" is all caps, I have a
[letter](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20050617/letfeat17.art.htm)
in that paper today. It's the third one down.

  
It's not that good. I like what I write at
[Gristmill](http://gristmill.grist.org) much better. I get more than 68 words
there.
