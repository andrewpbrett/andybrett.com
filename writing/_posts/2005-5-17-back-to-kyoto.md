title: "Back to Kyoto"

[134 US
cities](http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1485595,00.html?gusrc=rss)
have pledged to cut emissions by as much as the US would have had to had it
signed on to Kyoto.

  
This is, obviously, great news. When I took apart Kyoto, it was as an
international treaty that exempted some major players in climate change and
thus strayed from the idea that a treaty should get everyone to "sit down
together." If individuals or cities want to take the first step themselves,
more power to them (pun intended); many people it seems are starting to see
the writing (or the thermometer) on the wall and realize that this is going to
be dealt with eventually and it's profitable to mobilize sooner rather than
later.
