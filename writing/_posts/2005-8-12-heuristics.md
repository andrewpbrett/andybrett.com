I think I have discovered the word for a lot of what I've been mulling over
lately: [heuristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic). See my rambling
[comment](http://gristmill.grist.org/comments/2005/8/11/22416/5755/1#1) this
morning for more.

  
It's also a good feeling to see that Daniel Kahneman, who will be my professor
this fall, is mentioned in almost all of the material related to the matter.
