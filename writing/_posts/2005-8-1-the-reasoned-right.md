title: "The Reasoned Right"
---
I'm now a contributor at the newly minted blog [The Reasoned
Right](http://www.thereasonedright.com). I didn't like the name at first, but
I will admit, it's starting to grow on me. The blog is....well, you might have
to ask Rob about that, but my understanding is that it is a collection of
libertarian thought.

  
Don't you just love that new-car smell?
