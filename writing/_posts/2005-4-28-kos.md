I know. Kos again. I don't want this to turn into a Kos-watch blog. But I am
finally starting to sift through the RSS boxes, and it's not even the second
one down before I get to [this
gem](http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/4/27/11456/3671) from Kos. Seems
he's got his hands on the story about the Patterns of Global Terrorism Report
getting canned (which you could have read about on [my
blog](http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/04/whats-better-than-flawed-
report-no.html) ten days ago) and he's all in a huff. Nowhere, not in the
post, and not in the 102
[comments](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/4/27/11456/3671) that follow,
does anybody mention the fact that a completely new methodology is being used,
which has [more to do with the increase](http://counterterror.typepad.com/the_
counterterrorism_blog/2005/04/goodby_patterns.html) than an actual spike.

  
I take that back. There is now [one
person](http://www.dailykos.com/comments/2005/4/27/11456/3671/102#102) who
mentions it. :-)
