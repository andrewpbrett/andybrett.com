title: "Persuasion, Dead?"

Matt Miller [proposes just
that](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/04/opinion/04miller_oped.html) today in
his guest column. Read the whole thing ;-)

  
I don't think persuasion is dead. This gets, if it is really taken to its
fullest line of thought, into some issues about how the human mind actually
works, (How We Know What Isn't So, etc.) and is really starting to crop up
over and over again for me, which makes me think that a salient argument
against taking a year off of school next year is that I won't be in this class
I'm really looking forward to, The Psychology of Decision Making. That is
still up in the air...
