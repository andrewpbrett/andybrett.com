This is a blatant plug, but they have earned it.

I've been using RimuHosting for the new project I've been working on, and
their support is nothing short of amazing. There have been a number of times
that I've gotten stuck with some sort of config issue, sent them an email
about it, gone to bed, and woke up the next morning to find that the problem
was solved. I highly recommend them.
