title: "House Energy Bill"
---
The House just passed an [Energy
Bill](http://energycommerce.house.gov/108/energy_pdfs_2.htm), which, among
other things, amends the Clean Air Act so that "downwind" states don't have to
meet stricter regulations util "upwind" states do the same. While the issue of
air pollution traveling from state to state is a big one, giving some states
exemptions is not the way to deal with it.
