After finishing up with "stormchasing" this summer in Baltimore, I am still
trying to figure out what to do afterwards. At this point, of course, I have
completed registration, housing, etc. as though I were coming back to school
as a junior, but I am also seriously contemplating taking a year off. (I have
been for a couple of weeks now; see parts
[one](http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/04/and-now-for-something-
completely.html), [two](http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/05/drinking-
from-firehose-or-completely.html), and
[three](http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/05/drinking-from-firehose-or-
completely.html).)

  
The primary target as far as what I'd be doing has thus far been Engineers
Without Borders. I've been emailing with some people for them and if I did
this it looks like I would wind up working on projects in either Macedonia or
India. This would be great. The only thing is I don't know if it would last
the whole nine or twelve months that I would be off of school. I suppose I
could say I'll start in September and work as long as possible and figure out
the rest when I figure it out. Figuring out if I would have living expenses
covered is another huge question.

  
Doing something in the States would also be interesting as well. I am keeping
an ear to the ground for anything that might seem interesting; however, this
is serving to convince me that maybe I should plan to do this after junior
year and spend the whole year feeling out opportunities until something really
cool comes along. After all, I will most likely only take one year off, so it
hypothetically really wouldn't matter when I did it.
