Alas, poor Blogspot. I knew him well. That's right - it's time for bigger and
better things, this time in the form of a shiny new (hand-crafted!) [blogging
platform](http://www.andrewpbrett.com/blog).

  
More details are in the [inaugural post](http://www.andrewpbrett.com/posts/1).
This final post here is mainly to say that if you are one of the brave souls
reading this via RSS, please [update your
feed](http://www.andrewpbrett.com/posts.atom) - and thanks for reading!
