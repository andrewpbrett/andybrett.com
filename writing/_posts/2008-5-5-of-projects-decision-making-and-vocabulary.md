title: "Of Projects, Decision-Making, and Vocabulary"

The sun began to set over the mountains, which had been turned light green by
the slowly advancing line of new spring leaves that had nearly reached its
peak of the tree line. The second of two days of deck deconstruction and
reconstruction was coming to an end, and looking around, I was secretly
disappointed at how little visible progress we'd made.

  
At some point during those two days I'd had a flash of insight, the kind of
moment when you can practically feel the synapse firing in your brain. This is
just like a software engineering project. And not just because we got less
done than we intended, either. The more I thought about what we had undertaken
and accomplished, the more parallels I saw.

  
The project as a whole was a deck deconstruction (several supports and pieces
of the deck itself were old and rotting) followed by a reconstruction. It may
help to put a microscope on one specific example here. Since several supports
had been replaced and had slightly different dimensions than the old ones,
some of the deckboards were no longer completely snug with these supports.
Definitely not a structural issue, but a minor aesthetic one; also, the boards
themselves were certainly aging as well, but it wasn't completely necessary to
replace them. In other words, a tossup on whether or not to rip them out and
replace them with new boards.

  
The owner of the deck, an elderly but still strapping gentleman who was also
the foreman of this two-man work team, decided that there was reason enough to
install new boards. Prior to making that decision, he probably did a quick
cost-benefit in his head - how much better will it look with new boards? What
about the fact that the new boards won't match with the old ones? How long
will it take to rip up the old boards and put in the new ones? Are there any
requirements from the client (his wife) about what the deck should look like
or how long it should take? What are the penalties associated with not meeting
those requirements?

  
Further similarities emerged after I started to take the board out. The nails
used to hold the boards in were very old and tough to remove; it was therefore
taking much longer to finish the first part than anticipated. Do you continue
on the current path? Maybe even reassess the situation and make another
decision with the new information?

  
At another point we realized that the ideal tools/supplies we needed were in
town, a 30 minute drive. Another decision - do we use a "workaround" (very
common term on a software project)? Sacrifice the time to get the supplies?
How does that impact the amount of daylight we have to work with, and is there
anything else we could pick up from town while we are there to make it more
appealing to go?

  
I also realized (again) that I tend to think in very general terms about
things - this is part of the reason I make these far-flung connections in the
first place when other people think I'm off my rocker. A "project" is
therefore anything that one or more people put their time into (ideally with
some sort of plan for it), a "client" is anyone that anyone has to answer to,
"requirements" are the things that constrain the design and give the project a
shape and direction. People that work as consultants have similar mindsets -
which may be why very little "actual" vocabulary is required outside of
technical vocab. But in some sense, everyone is a consultant, since everyone
works with resources, such as their own time, skills, and wealth, in order to
create something for a client. In the ultimate meta-thought: the term
"consultant" itself has become vague to the point of meaninglessness.

  
Profound thought of the day: The nuances no longer come in the words we use to
describe the world, but rather from our experiences as we interact with that
world.
