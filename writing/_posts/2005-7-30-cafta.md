title: "CAFTA"
---
In principle, free trade is good. But the US has got to practice what it
preaches. Every time I hear someone praise CAFTA because of the agricultural
market that it opens up for the US farm industry, I cringe, since the US farm
industry is so heavily subsidized.

  
The [Cleveland Plain Dealer](http://www.cleveland.com/editorials/plaindealer/i
ndex.ssf?/base/opinion/112271600760650.xml&coll=2) came out in support of the
agreement, citing the vote of Steve Latourette (my representative) as the
"deciding vote." Sure, it was 217-216, but that makes everyone's vote the
deciding vote.
