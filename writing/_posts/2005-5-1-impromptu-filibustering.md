title: "Impromptu Filibustering"

So I am now blogging from the filibuster tent at the [Frist Center Filibuster
Protest](http://www.filibusterfrist.com). We're listening to The Art of
Worldly Wisdom by Baltasar Gracian, as read by Katy Lankester. This is one of
the times that I am really impressed with Princeton students, to keep this up
around the clock. This is a really nice PowerBook G4 that they've got here,
although I have no idea whose it is. Apparently I am now the organizer on
duty...
