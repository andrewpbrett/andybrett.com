I'm having trouble with the FTP transfer with photos...and when I copy and
paste in code from a blogspot hosted blog, the photos show up intermittently.
I think the thing to do here is to set up a "photo blog" which will provide
urls for photos and then just link to them, since even if I can get the FTP to
start working I will not want tons of photos on my H drive.
