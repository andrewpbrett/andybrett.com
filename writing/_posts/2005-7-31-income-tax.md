My two principles of tax reform:

  * Make the return fit on a postcard
  * Make people cut a check for the whole amount on April 15
Both of these are examples like I
[mentioned](http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/07/what-to-do-nothing.html)
yesterday of policies that make sense but have no chance of being enacted,
because

  * The massive tax code and its pages of loopholes are a vehicle that delivers pork, which is the way politicians are reelected, and also keep tax shelters in business.
  * If people had to write a check for 20% of their yearly income once a year, the government would see a huge rise in the number of people that just couldn't pay the amount.
The benefit to #1 is obvious. The benefit to #2 would be that people would
feel the effects much more deeply and would be a little more interested in
where their money was actually going.
