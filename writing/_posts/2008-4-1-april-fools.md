title: "April Fool's"

I'll be honest. The very first thing I did in front of my laptop today was to
try to find Google's April Fool's joke. I quickly found the new "feature" of
Gmail ([Custom Time](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/customtime/index.html)).
Pretty good. And the "[Wake-up
Kit](http://www.google.com/googlecalendar/new_wakeup.html)" in Google
Calendar. Not bad. And the "I'm feeling lucky" button for events, which set me
up on "dates" with Angelina Jolie, Anna Kournikova, Pamela Anderson, Jessica
Alba, and (yikes!) Paris Hilton.


But I knew there had to be something... more.


And there was. [Google Virgle](http://www.google.com/virgle/index.html).


I had to sign out of iGoogle and visit the classic home page twice before I
found the link, but oh boy, it was worth it. Over the next one hundred years,
Google and Virgin Inc. will lead an "interplanetary Noah's Ark" to create a
self-sustaining population of over 100,000 Martians, living on the first [open
source planet](http://www.google.com/virgle/opensource.html) in the universe.


There's an application to become a pioneer in the "adventure of many
lifetimes" as well as an FAQ - the highlight of that might be:


How'd you learn all this stuff?


Reading. Surfing. Studying. Cramming. Arguing. Improvising. Special thanks to
the brilliant minds at the invaluable [Mars
Society](http://www.marssociety.org/portal)


There's even a post on the [Official Google
Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/announcing-project-virgle.html)
from Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Inc.


Well done, Googlers.
